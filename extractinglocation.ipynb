       "  '(Bloomberg) -- In an episode that underscores the vulnerability of global computer networks, hackers got ahold of login credentials for data centers in Asia used by some of the world’s biggest businesses, a potential bonanza for spying or sabotage, according to a cybersecurity research firm.\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\nUS-China Meeting Only Worsens Tensions Over Balloon, Russia\\nBiden Meets Zelenskiy on Surprise Trip Nearly Year Into War\\nRussia and China Have a Stranglehold on the World’s Food Security\\nStocks Muted, US Futures Fall as China Bets Fade: Markets Wrap\\nThe previously unreported data caches involve emails and passwords for customer-support websites for two of the largest data center operators in Asia: Shanghai-based GDS Holdings Ltd. and Singapore-based ST Telemedia Global Data Centres, according to Resecurity Inc., which provides cybersecurity services and investigates hackers. About 2,000 customers of GDS and STT GDC were affected. Hackers have logged into the accounts of at least five of them, including China’s main foreign exchange and debt trading platform and four others from India, according to Resecurity, which said it infiltrated the hacking group.\\nIt’s not clear what — if anything — the hackers did with the other logins. The information included credentials in varying numbers for some of the world’s biggest companies, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., BMW AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Huawei Technologies Co., Microsoft Corp. , and Walmart Inc., according to the security firm and hundreds of pages of documents that Bloomberg reviewed.\\nResponding to questions about Resecurity’s findings, GDS said in a statement that a customer support website was breached in 2021. It’s not clear how the hackers obtained the STT GDC data. That company said it found no evidence that its customer service portal was compromised that year. Both companies said the rogue credentials didn’t pose a risk to clients’ IT systems or data.\\nHowever, Resecurity and executives at four major US-based companies that were affected said the stolen credentials represented an unusual and serious danger, primarily because the customer-support websites control who is allowed to physically access the IT equipment housed in the data centers. Those executives, who learned about the incidents from Bloomberg News and corroborated the information with their security teams, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the matter.\\nSign up for our weekly cybersecurity newsletter, the Cyber Bulletin, here.\\nThe magnitude of the data loss reported by Resecurity highlights the growing risk companies face because of their dependency on third parties to house data and IT equipment and help their networks reach global markets. Security experts say the issue is particularly acute in China, which requires corporations to partner with local data service providers.\\n“This is a nightmare waiting to happen,” said Michael Henry, former chief information officer for Digital Realty Trust Inc., one of the biggest US data center operators, when told about the incidents by Bloomberg. (Digital Realty Trust wasn’t affected by the incidents). The worst-case scenario for any data center operator is that attackers somehow get physical access to clients’ servers and install malicious code or additional equipment, Henry said. “If they can achieve that, they can potentially disrupt communications and commerce on a massive scale.”\\nGDS and STT GDC said they had no indication that anything like that happened, and that their core services weren’t impacted.\\nThe hackers had access to the login credentials for more than a year before posting it for sale on the dark web last month, for $175,000, saying they were overwhelmed by the volume of it, according to Resecurity and a screenshot of the posting reviewed by Bloomberg.\\n“I used some targets,” the hackers said in the post. “But unable to handle as total number of companies is over 2,000.”\\nThe email addresses and passwords could have allowed hackers to masquerade as authorized users on the customer service websites, according to Resecurity. The security firm discovered the data caches in September 2021 and said it also found evidence the hackers were using it to access accounts of GDS and STT GDC customers as recently as January, when both data center operators forced customer password resets, according to Resecurity.\\nEven without valid passwords, the data would still be valuable — allowing hackers to craft targeted phishing emails against people with high-level access to their companies’ networks, according to Resecurity.\\nMost of the affected companies that Bloomberg News contacted, including Alibaba, Amazon, Huawei and Walmart, declined to comment. Apple didn’t respond to messages seeking comment.\\nIn a statement, Microsoft said, “We regularly monitor for threats that could impact Microsoft and when potential threats are identified we take appropriate action to protect Microsoft and our customers.” A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs said, “We have in place additional controls to protect against this type of breach and we are satisfied that our data was not at risk.”\\nThe automaker BMW said it was aware of the issue. But a company spokesperson said, “After assessment, the issue has a very limited impact on BMW businesses and has caused no damage to BMW customers and product related information.” The spokesperson added, “BMW has urged GDS to improve the information security level.”\\nGDS and STT GDC are two of Asia’s biggest providers of “colocation” services. They act as landlords, renting space in their data centers to clients that install and manage their own IT equipment there, typically to be closer to customers and business operations in Asia. GDS is among the top three colocation providers in China, the second-biggest market for the service in the world after the US, according to Synergy Research Group Inc. Singapore ranks sixth.\\nThe companies are also intertwined: a corporate filing shows that in 2014, Singapore Technologies Telemedia Pte, the parent of the STT GDC, acquired a 40% stake in GDS.\\nResecurity Chief Executive Officer Gene Yoo said his firm uncovered the incidents in 2021 after one of its operatives went undercover to infiltrate a hacking group in China that had attacked government targets in Taiwan.\\nSoon after, it alerted GDS and STT GDC and a small number of Resecurity clients that were impacted, according to Yoo and the documents.\\nResecurity notified GDS and STT GDC again in January after discovered the hackers accessing accounts, and the security firm also alerted authorities in China and Singapore at that time, according to Yoo and the documents.\\nBoth data center operators said they responded promptly when notified about the security issues and started internal investigations.\\nCheryl Lee, a spokesperson for the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, said the agency “is aware of the incident and is assisting ST Telemedia on this matter.” The National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China, a non-governmental organization that handles cyber emergency response, didn’t respond to messages seeking comment.\\nGDS acknowledged that a customer-support website was breached and said that it investigated and fixed a vulnerability in the site in 2021.\\n“The application which was targeted by hackers is limited in scope and information to non-critical service functions, such as making ticketing requests, scheduling physical delivery of equipment and reviewing maintenance reports,” according to a company statement. “Requests made through the application typically require offline follow up and confirmation. Given the basic nature of the application, the breach did not result in any threat to our customers’ IT operations.”\\nSTT GDC said it brought in external cybersecurity experts when it learned about the incident in 2021. “The IT system in question is a customer service ticketing tool” and “has no connection to other corporate systems nor any critical data infrastructure,” the company said.\\nThe company said its customer service portal wasn’t breached in 2021 and that the credentials obtained by Resecurity are “a partial and outdated list of user credentials for our customer ticketing applications. Any such data is now invalid and does not pose a security risk going forward.”\\n“No unauthorized access or data loss was observed,” according to STT GDC’s statement.\\nRegardless of how the hackers may have used the information, cybersecurity experts said the thefts shows that attackers are exploring novel ways to infiltrate hard targets.\\nThe physical security of IT equipment in third-party data centers and the systems for controlling access to it represent vulnerabilities that are often overlooked by corporate security departments, said Malcolm Harkins, former chief security and privacy offer of Intel Corp. Any tampering of data center equipment “could have devastating consequences,” Harkins said.\\nThe hackers obtained email addresses and passwords for more than 3,000 people at GDS — including its own employees and those of its customers — and more than 1,000 from STT GDC, according to the documents reviewed by Bloomberg News.\\nThe hackers also stole credentials for GDS’s network of more than 30,000 surveillance cameras, most of which relied on simple passwords such as “admin” or “admin12345,” the documents show. GDS didn’t address a question about the alleged theft of credentials to the camera network, or about the passwords.\\nThe number of login credentials for the customer-support websites varied for different customers. For instance, there were 201 accounts at Alibaba, 99 at Amazon, 32 at Microsoft, 16 at Baidu Inc., 15 at Bank of America Corp., seven at Bank of China Ltd., four at Apple and three at Goldman, according to the documents. Resecurity’s Yoo said the hackers only need one valid email address and password to access a company’s account on the customer service portal.\\nAmong the other companies whose workers’ login details were obtained, according to Resecurity and the documents, were: Bharti Airtel Ltd. in India, Bloomberg LP (the owner of Bloomberg News), ByteDance Ltd., Ford Motor Co., Globe Telecom Inc. in the Philippines, Mastercard Inc., Morgan Stanley, Paypal Holdings Inc., Porsche AG, SoftBank Corp., Telstra Group Ltd. in Australia, Tencent Holdings Ltd., Verizon Communications Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co.\\nIn a statement, Baidu said, “We do not believe that any data was compromised. Baidu pays great attention to ensure the data security of our customers. We will keep a close eye on matters such as this and remain on alert to any emerging threats to data security in any part of our operations.”\\nA representative for Porsche said, “In this specific case we have no indication that there was any risk.” A SoftBank representative said a Chinese subsidiary stopped using GDS last year. “No customer information data leakage from the local China company has been confirmed, nor has there been any impact on its business and services,” the representative said.\\nA spokesperson for Telstra said, “We are not aware of any impact to the business following this breach,” while a Mastercard representative said, “While we continue to monitor this situation, we are not aware of any risks to our business or impact to our transaction network or systems.”\\nA representative for Tencent said, “We are not aware of any impact to the business following this breach. We manage our servers inside data centers directly, with data center facility operators having no access to any data stored on Tencent servers. We have not discovered any unauthorized access of our IT systems and servers after investigation, which remain safe and secure.”\\nA spokesperson for Wells Fargo said it used GDS for backup IT infrastructure until December 2022. “GDS did not have access to Wells Fargo data, systems, or the Wells Fargo network,” the company said. The other companies all declined to comment or didn’t respond.\\nResecurity’s Yoo said that in January, his firm’s undercover operative pressed the hackers for a demonstration of whether they still had access to accounts. The hackers provided screenshots showing them logging into accounts for five companies and navigating to different pages in the GDS and STT GDC online portals, he said. Resecurity allowed Bloomberg News to review those screenshots.\\nAt GDS, the hackers accessed an account for the China Foreign Exchange Trade System, an arm of China’s central bank that plays a key role in that country’s economy, operating the government’s main foreign exchange and debt trading platform, according to the screenshots and Resecurity. The organization didn’t respond to messages.\\nAt STT GDC, the hackers accessed accounts for the National Internet Exchange of India, an organization that connects internet providers across the country, and three others based in India: MyLink Services Pvt., Skymax Broadband Services Pvt., and Logix InfoSecurity Pvt., the screenshots show.\\nReached by Bloomberg, the National Internet Exchange of India said it wasn’t aware of the incident and declined further comment. None of the other organizations in India responded to requests for comment.\\nAsked about the claim that hackers were still accessing accounts in January using the stolen credentials, a GDS representative said, “Recently, we detected multiple new attacks from hackers using the old account access information. We have used various technical tools to block these attacks. So far, we haven’t found any new successful break-in from hackers which is due to our system vulnerability.”\\nThe GDS representative added, “As we are aware, one single customer didn’t reset one of their account passwords to this application which belonged to an ex-employee of theirs. That is the reason why we recently forced a password reset for all the users. We believe this is an isolated event. It is not a result of hackers breaking through our security system.”\\nSTT GDC said it received notification in January of further threats to customer service portals in “our India and Thailand regions.” “Our investigations to date indicate that there has been no data loss or impact to any of these customer service portals,” the company said.\\nIn late January, after GDS and STT GDC changed customers’ passwords, Resecurity spotted the hackers posting the databases for sale on a dark web forum, in English and Chinese, according to Yoo.\\n“DBs contain customer information, can be used for phishing, access of cabinets, monitoring of orders and equipment, remote hands orders,” the post stated. “Who can assist with targeted phishing?”\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\nThe Staged Bomb Scare That Backfired on Mumbai’s Notorious Cops\\nZantac’s Maker Kept Quiet About Cancer Risks for 40 Years\\nThe World’s War Machine Is Running Low on Ammunition\\nHow to Make Sure Your Resume Isn’t Overlooked — Without Lying\\nFear Made John McAfee Rich.

The tech giant is integrating OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT AI into its Bing search engine.\\n“We’ll probably add a 1% weighting into ChatGPT in the portfolio that should hold that, although I’m holding my nose on valuation. I’m choking,\" O\\'Leary added.\\nTwo elements of ChatGPT have caught the attention of O\\'Leary, a savvy businessman and investor from Canada. First is the raw downloads of the ChatGPT technology which hint at significant market share gains over AI rivals into the future.\\nChatGPT crossed the 100 million users milestone in January, according to recent data from Demand Sage.\\n“Now, tell me that\\'s [the downloads] not killing Google, and it is,\" O\\'Leary said.\\nAnother key selling point for O\\'Leary is the financially lucrative recurring revenue associated with ChatGPT. According to O’Leary, some of his employees subscribe to the $ 20-a-month premium ChatGPT feature.\\nThe feature allows users to access the service when the free version is down – which happens frequently.\\n“They\\'re getting revenue all of the sudden because they\\'re so popular,” O\\'Leary said.\\nUltimately, O\\'Leary believes the OpenAI owned-ChatGPT could be a game changer in the search engine market, where Google has reigned.

Alphabet — seen as behind Microsoft in the AI wars with Bard — has seen its stock tank 5% in February.\\n\"While initially it feels like Google rushed Bard to market with the Microsoft ChatGPT deal and event overshadowing the company, this race will be a long one and we expect Google as well as Apple, Meta, and other tech stalwarts to spend billions in this AI arms race over the coming years,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said in a note.\\nSarah A.

       "  '(Bloomberg) -- In an episode that underscores the vulnerability of global computer networks, hackers got ahold of login credentials for data centers in Asia used by some of the world’s biggest businesses, a potential bonanza for spying or sabotage, according to a cybersecurity research firm.\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\nUS-China Meeting Only Worsens Tensions Over Balloon, Russia\\nBiden Meets Zelenskiy on Surprise Trip Nearly Year Into War\\nRussia and China Have a Stranglehold on the World’s Food Security\\nStocks Muted, US Futures Fall as China Bets Fade: Markets Wrap\\nThe previously unreported data caches involve emails and passwords for customer-support websites for two of the largest data center operators in Asia: Shanghai-based GDS Holdings Ltd. and Singapore-based ST Telemedia Global Data Centres, according to Resecurity Inc., which provides cybersecurity services and investigates hackers. About 2,000 customers of GDS and STT GDC were affected. Hackers have logged into the accounts of at least five of them, including China’s main foreign exchange and debt trading platform and four others from India, according to Resecurity, which said it infiltrated the hacking group.\\nIt’s not clear what — if anything — the hackers did with the other logins. The information included credentials in varying numbers for some of the world’s biggest companies, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., BMW AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Huawei Technologies Co., Microsoft Corp. , and Walmart Inc., according to the security firm and hundreds of pages of documents that Bloomberg reviewed.\\nResponding to questions about Resecurity’s findings, GDS said in a statement that a customer support website was breached in 2021. It’s not clear how the hackers obtained the STT GDC data. That company said it found no evidence that its customer service portal was compromised that year. Both companies said the rogue credentials didn’t pose a risk to clients’ IT systems or data.\\nHowever, Resecurity and executives at four major US-based companies that were affected said the stolen credentials represented an unusual and serious danger, primarily because the customer-support websites control who is allowed to physically access the IT equipment housed in the data centers. Those executives, who learned about the incidents from Bloomberg News and corroborated the information with their security teams, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the matter.\\nSign up for our weekly cybersecurity newsletter, the Cyber Bulletin, here.\\nThe magnitude of the data loss reported by Resecurity highlights the growing risk companies face because of their dependency on third parties to house data and IT equipment and help their networks reach global markets. Security experts say the issue is particularly acute in China, which requires corporations to partner with local data service providers.\\n“This is a nightmare waiting to happen,” said Michael Henry, former chief information officer for Digital Realty Trust Inc., one of the biggest US data center operators, when told about the incidents by Bloomberg. (Digital Realty Trust wasn’t affected by the incidents). The worst-case scenario for any data center operator is that attackers somehow get physical access to clients’ servers and install malicious code or additional equipment, Henry said. “If they can achieve that, they can potentially disrupt communications and commerce on a massive scale.”\\nGDS and STT GDC said they had no indication that anything like that happened, and that their core services weren’t impacted.\\nThe hackers had access to the login credentials for more than a year before posting it for sale on the dark web last month, for $175,000, saying they were overwhelmed by the volume of it, according to Resecurity and a screenshot of the posting reviewed by Bloomberg.\\n“I used some targets,” the hackers said in the post. “But unable to handle as total number of companies is over 2,000.”\\nThe email addresses and passwords could have allowed hackers to masquerade as authorized users on the customer service websites, according to Resecurity. The security firm discovered the data caches in September 2021 and said it also found evidence the hackers were using it to access accounts of GDS and STT GDC customers as recently as January, when both data center operators forced customer password resets, according to Resecurity.\\nEven without valid passwords, the data would still be valuable — allowing hackers to craft targeted phishing emails against people with high-level access to their companies’ networks, according to Resecurity.\\nMost of the affected companies that Bloomberg News contacted, including Alibaba, Amazon, Huawei and Walmart, declined to comment. Apple didn’t respond to messages seeking comment.\\nIn a statement, Microsoft said, “We regularly monitor for threats that could impact Microsoft and when potential threats are identified we take appropriate action to protect Microsoft and our customers.” A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs said, “We have in place additional controls to protect against this type of breach and we are satisfied that our data was not at risk.”\\nThe automaker BMW said it was aware of the issue. But a company spokesperson said, “After assessment, the issue has a very limited impact on BMW businesses and has caused no damage to BMW customers and product related information.” The spokesperson added, “BMW has urged GDS to improve the information security level.”\\nGDS and STT GDC are two of Asia’s biggest providers of “colocation” services. They act as landlords, renting space in their data centers to clients that install and manage their own IT equipment there, typically to be closer to customers and business operations in Asia. GDS is among the top three colocation providers in China, the second-biggest market for the service in the world after the US, according to Synergy Research Group Inc. Singapore ranks sixth.\\nThe companies are also intertwined: a corporate filing shows that in 2014, Singapore Technologies Telemedia Pte, the parent of the STT GDC, acquired a 40% stake in GDS.\\nResecurity Chief Executive Officer Gene Yoo said his firm uncovered the incidents in 2021 after one of its operatives went undercover to infiltrate a hacking group in China that had attacked government targets in Taiwan.\\nSoon after, it alerted GDS and STT GDC and a small number of Resecurity clients that were impacted, according to Yoo and the documents.\\nResecurity notified GDS and STT GDC again in January after discovered the hackers accessing accounts, and the security firm also alerted authorities in China and Singapore at that time, according to Yoo and the documents.\\nBoth data center operators said they responded promptly when notified about the security issues and started internal investigations.\\nCheryl Lee, a spokesperson for the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, said the agency “is aware of the incident and is assisting ST Telemedia on this matter.” The National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China, a non-governmental organization that handles cyber emergency response, didn’t respond to messages seeking comment.\\nGDS acknowledged that a customer-support website was breached and said that it investigated and fixed a vulnerability in the site in 2021.\\n“The application which was targeted by hackers is limited in scope and information to non-critical service functions, such as making ticketing requests, scheduling physical delivery of equipment and reviewing maintenance reports,” according to a company statement. “Requests made through the application typically require offline follow up and confirmation. Given the basic nature of the application, the breach did not result in any threat to our customers’ IT operations.”\\nSTT GDC said it brought in external cybersecurity experts when it learned about the incident in 2021. “The IT system in question is a customer service ticketing tool” and “has no connection to other corporate systems nor any critical data infrastructure,” the company said.\\nThe company said its customer service portal wasn’t breached in 2021 and that the credentials obtained by Resecurity are “a partial and outdated list of user credentials for our customer ticketing applications. Any such data is now invalid and does not pose a security risk going forward.”\\n“No unauthorized access or data loss was observed,” according to STT GDC’s statement.\\nRegardless of how the hackers may have used the information, cybersecurity experts said the thefts shows that attackers are exploring novel ways to infiltrate hard targets.\\nThe physical security of IT equipment in third-party data centers and the systems for controlling access to it represent vulnerabilities that are often overlooked by corporate security departments, said Malcolm Harkins, former chief security and privacy offer of Intel Corp. Any tampering of data center equipment “could have devastating consequences,” Harkins said.\\nThe hackers obtained email addresses and passwords for more than 3,000 people at GDS — including its own employees and those of its customers — and more than 1,000 from STT GDC, according to the documents reviewed by Bloomberg News.\\nThe hackers also stole credentials for GDS’s network of more than 30,000 surveillance cameras, most of which relied on simple passwords such as “admin” or “admin12345,” the documents show. GDS didn’t address a question about the alleged theft of credentials to the camera network, or about the passwords.\\nThe number of login credentials for the customer-support websites varied for different customers. For instance, there were 201 accounts at Alibaba, 99 at Amazon, 32 at Microsoft, 16 at Baidu Inc., 15 at Bank of America Corp., seven at Bank of China Ltd., four at Apple and three at Goldman, according to the documents. Resecurity’s Yoo said the hackers only need one valid email address and password to access a company’s account on the customer service portal.\\nAmong the other companies whose workers’ login details were obtained, according to Resecurity and the documents, were: Bharti Airtel Ltd. in India, Bloomberg LP (the owner of Bloomberg News), ByteDance Ltd., Ford Motor Co., Globe Telecom Inc. in the Philippines, Mastercard Inc., Morgan Stanley, Paypal Holdings Inc., Porsche AG, SoftBank Corp., Telstra Group Ltd. in Australia, Tencent Holdings Ltd., Verizon Communications Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co.\\nIn a statement, Baidu said, “We do not believe that any data was compromised. Baidu pays great attention to ensure the data security of our customers. We will keep a close eye on matters such as this and remain on alert to any emerging threats to data security in any part of our operations.”\\nA representative for Porsche said, “In this specific case we have no indication that there was any risk.” A SoftBank representative said a Chinese subsidiary stopped using GDS last year. “No customer information data leakage from the local China company has been confirmed, nor has there been any impact on its business and services,” the representative said.\\nA spokesperson for Telstra said, “We are not aware of any impact to the business following this breach,” while a Mastercard representative said, “While we continue to monitor this situation, we are not aware of any risks to our business or impact to our transaction network or systems.”\\nA representative for Tencent said, “We are not aware of any impact to the business following this breach. We manage our servers inside data centers directly, with data center facility operators having no access to any data stored on Tencent servers. We have not discovered any unauthorized access of our IT systems and servers after investigation, which remain safe and secure.”\\nA spokesperson for Wells Fargo said it used GDS for backup IT infrastructure until December 2022. “GDS did not have access to Wells Fargo data, systems, or the Wells Fargo network,” the company said. The other companies all declined to comment or didn’t respond.\\nResecurity’s Yoo said that in January, his firm’s undercover operative pressed the hackers for a demonstration of whether they still had access to accounts. The hackers provided screenshots showing them logging into accounts for five companies and navigating to different pages in the GDS and STT GDC online portals, he said. Resecurity allowed Bloomberg News to review those screenshots.\\nAt GDS, the hackers accessed an account for the China Foreign Exchange Trade System, an arm of China’s central bank that plays a key role in that country’s economy, operating the government’s main foreign exchange and debt trading platform, according to the screenshots and Resecurity. The organization didn’t respond to messages.\\nAt STT GDC, the hackers accessed accounts for the National Internet Exchange of India, an organization that connects internet providers across the country, and three others based in India: MyLink Services Pvt., Skymax Broadband Services Pvt., and Logix InfoSecurity Pvt., the screenshots show.\\nReached by Bloomberg, the National Internet Exchange of India said it wasn’t aware of the incident and declined further comment. None of the other organizations in India responded to requests for comment.\\nAsked about the claim that hackers were still accessing accounts in January using the stolen credentials, a GDS representative said, “Recently, we detected multiple new attacks from hackers using the old account access information. We have used various technical tools to block these attacks. So far, we haven’t found any new successful break-in from hackers which is due to our system vulnerability.”\\nThe GDS representative added, “As we are aware, one single customer didn’t reset one of their account passwords to this application which belonged to an ex-employee of theirs. That is the reason why we recently forced a password reset for all the users. We believe this is an isolated event. It is not a result of hackers breaking through our security system.”\\nSTT GDC said it received notification in January of further threats to customer service portals in “our India and Thailand regions.” “Our investigations to date indicate that there has been no data loss or impact to any of these customer service portals,” the company said.\\nIn late January, after GDS and STT GDC changed customers’ passwords, Resecurity spotted the hackers posting the databases for sale on a dark web forum, in English and Chinese, according to Yoo.\\n“DBs contain customer information, can be used for phishing, access of cabinets, monitoring of orders and equipment, remote hands orders,” the post stated. “Who can assist with targeted phishing?”\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\nThe Staged Bomb Scare That Backfired on Mumbai’s Notorious Cops\\nZantac’s Maker Kept Quiet About Cancer Risks for 40 Years\\nThe World’s War Machine Is Running Low on Ammunition\\nHow to Make Sure Your Resume Isn’t Overlooked — Without Lying\\nFear Made John McAfee Rich.

GDS didn’t address a question about the alleged theft of credentials to the camera network, or about the passwords.\\nThe number of login credentials for the customer-support websites varied for different customers. For instance, there were 201 accounts at Alibaba, 99 at Amazon, 32 at Microsoft, 16 at Baidu Inc., 15 at Bank of America Corp., seven at Bank of China Ltd., four at Apple and three at Goldman, according to the documents. Resecurity’s Yoo said the hackers only need one valid email address and password to access a company’s account on the customer service portal.\\nAmong the other companies whose workers’ login details were obtained, according to Resecurity and the documents, were: Bharti Airtel Ltd. in India, Bloomberg LP (the owner of Bloomberg News), ByteDance Ltd., Ford Motor Co., Globe Telecom Inc. in the Philippines, Mastercard Inc., Morgan Stanley, Paypal Holdings Inc., Porsche AG, SoftBank Corp., Telstra Group Ltd. in Australia, Tencent Holdings Ltd., Verizon Communications Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co.\\nIn a statement, Baidu said, “We do not believe that any data was compromised. Baidu pays great attention to ensure the data security of our customers. We will keep a close eye on matters such as this and remain on alert to any emerging threats to data security in any part of our operations.”\\nA representative for Porsche said, “In this specific case we have no indication that there was any risk.” A SoftBank representative said a Chinese subsidiary stopped using GDS last year. “No customer information data leakage from the local China company has been confirmed, nor has there been any impact on its business and services,” the representative said.\\nA spokesperson for Telstra said, “We are not aware of any impact to the business following this breach,” while a Mastercard representative said, “While we continue to monitor this situation, we are not aware of any risks to our business or impact to our transaction network or systems.”\\nA representative for Tencent said, “We are not aware of any impact to the business following this breach. We manage our servers inside data centers directly, with data center facility operators having no access to any data stored on Tencent servers. We have not discovered any unauthorized access of our IT systems and servers after investigation, which remain safe and secure.”\\nA spokesperson for Wells Fargo said it used GDS for backup IT infrastructure until December 2022. “GDS did not have access to Wells Fargo data, systems, or the Wells Fargo network,” the company said. The other companies all declined to comment or didn’t respond.\\nResecurity’s Yoo said that in January, his firm’s undercover operative pressed the hackers for a demonstration of whether they still had access to accounts. The hackers provided screenshots showing them logging into accounts for five companies and navigating to different pages in the GDS and STT GDC online portals, he said. Resecurity allowed Bloomberg News to review those screenshots.\\nAt GDS, the hackers accessed an account for the China Foreign Exchange Trade System, an arm of China’s central bank that plays a key role in that country’s economy, operating the government’s main foreign exchange and debt trading platform, according to the screenshots and Resecurity. The organization didn’t respond to messages.\\nAt STT GDC, the hackers accessed accounts for the National Internet Exchange of India, an organization that connects internet providers across the country, and three others based in India: MyLink Services Pvt., Skymax Broadband Services Pvt., and Logix InfoSecurity Pvt., the screenshots show.\\nReached by Bloomberg, the National Internet Exchange of India said it wasn’t aware of the incident and declined further comment. None of the other organizations in India responded to requests for comment.\\nAsked about the claim that hackers were still accessing accounts in January using the stolen credentials, a GDS representative said, “Recently, we detected multiple new attacks from hackers using the old account access information. We have used various technical tools to block these attacks. So far, we haven’t found any new successful break-in from hackers which is due to our system vulnerability.”\\nThe GDS representative added, “As we are aware, one single customer didn’t reset one of their account passwords to this application which belonged to an ex-employee of theirs. That is the reason why we recently forced a password reset for all the users. We believe this is an isolated event. It is not a result of hackers breaking through our security system.”\\nSTT GDC said it received notification in January of further threats to customer service portals in “our India and Thailand regions.” “Our investigations to date indicate that there has been no data loss or impact to any of these customer service portals,” the company said.\\nIn late January, after GDS and STT GDC changed customers’ passwords, Resecurity spotted the hackers posting the databases for sale on a dark web forum, in English and Chinese, according to Yoo.\\n“DBs contain customer information, can be used for phishing, access of cabinets, monitoring of orders and equipment, remote hands orders,” the post stated. “Who can assist with targeted phishing?”\\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\\nThe Staged Bomb Scare That Backfired on Mumbai’s Notorious Cops\\nZantac’s Maker Kept Quiet About Cancer Risks for 40 Years\\nThe World’s War Machine Is Running Low on Ammunition\\nHow to Make Sure Your Resume Isn’t Overlooked — Without Lying\\nFear Made John McAfee Rich.

       "  'Investors don\\'t need to look hard to find sustainable companies commanding decent returns, a recent report found.\\nThe 2023 Clean 200 from nonprofit shareholder activist As You Sow and research firm Corporate Knights leveraged the Corporate Knights Sustainable Economy Taxonomy to rank the top 200 publicly-traded companies, out of a pool of 6,720 global firms, \"based on rigorous assessment of the amount of revenue each company earns from products and services.\"\\nApple (AAPL) topped the list with $259 billion in sustainable revenue, with an estimated 71% of the tech giant\\'s revenue coming from sustainable sources, after not even making the list two years ago.\\nGoogle-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) ranked second with $228.7 billion in clean revenue, followed by Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE.DE) ($89 billion), Verizon Communications (VZ) ($80 billion), and Tesla (TSLA) ($53 billion).\\n“The spread of the great transition that we\\'re in the middle of is spreading out even further globally — that every country in the world will soon have major companies making major money employing major numbers of people as part of this global transformation,” As You Sow CEO Andrew Behar told Yahoo Finance.\\nWhat began in 2016 as a list of companies leading in clean energy has since expanded to encompass revenue that meets a range of sustainability certifications from electric vehicles to sustainable loans. The list excludes companies with exposure to controversial business practices such as investments in fossil fuels, weapons, and prisons or otherwise \"having a record of systemically obstructing climate policy.\"\\n\"These are the companies that are leading the way by putting sustainability at the heart of their products, services, business models and investments, helping to move the world onto a more sustainable trajectory,\" the report stated.\\nThis year\\'s Clean 200 list also spanned 35 countries, with the most companies listed in the U.S., China, and Japan. And with the exception of energy, there was broad sector representation: Industrials companies were prevalent as were information technology, materials, and utility companies.\\n“It\\'s not just clean energy,” Toby Heaps, CEO of Corporate Knights, told Yahoo Finance. \"It’s the entire economy, from Google\\'s advertising that comes from sustainability-focused companies to plant-based milks.”\\nApple has made strides in recent years in using recycled materials and rare earth minerals.\\n\"Over time, they\\'ve really kind of gone to town on their whole supply chain,\" Heaps explained. \"They\\'re getting zero-carbon or almost zero-carbon aluminum and making the iPhone... We\\'ve looked at about 300 eco-labels, certifications, and Apple now builds... a large enough chunk of its products that they qualify for the high standards.\"\\nApple\\'s sustainable revenue primarily comes from the sale of iPhones, iPads, and Macs, all of which have been awarded EPEAT Gold certification. Criteria for the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) global ecolabel considers hardware products\\' materials, supply chain greenhouse gas emissions, product longevity, energy conservation, and end-of-life management, among other factors.\\nThe company offers eight devices with more than 20% recycled material, according to its 2022 sustainability report. The 2020 MacBook Air with an M1 chip has the highest amount of recycled materials — 44% of the laptop is recycled, including a 100% recycled aluminum enclosure.\\nAs of 2021, Apple began using recycled gold and tungsten in all of its iPhones. Apple shipped roughly 225 million iPhones in 2022.\\nAt the same time, Apple is far from perfect when it comes to selling sustainably-sourced products at scale. The tech giant has come under pressure from consumers and governments who have argued the company makes it too difficult to repair its devices, leading to shorter life cycles for its electronics.\\nDespite launching Self Service Repair, a platform that lets customers order parts and browse instructions for repairing devices, Apple has thrown its weight against state right-to-repair laws, including a watered-down law passed in New York in 2022.\\nGoogle has consistently ranked among the top two Clean 200 companies over the past several years.\\nGoogle\\'s clean revenue primarily derives from advertising on Google Maps, which has features aimed at reducing carbon emissions in transportation, as well as cloud services powered by renewable energy.\\nAnd Tesla, Elon Musk\\'s electric vehicle company, has been a pioneer in increasing the adoption of EVs and decarbonizing the transportation sector. At the same time, the company has underperformed on other ESG metrics, such as taxes paid and labor controversies.\\n\"Tesla is a poor discloser of operational metrics, and where it does disclose, it scores bottom quartile performance on waste and taxes paid (just 4.7% of EBITDA paid in cash taxes over the past five years),\" Matthew Malinsky, research manager at Corporate Knights, told Yahoo Finance.\\xa0\"But Tesla has excellent products focused on EVs. So when you apply 50% weight to products and 50% to operations, Tesla is the most sustainable car company in the U.S., and one of the most sustainable companies on the planet.\"\\nTwo big corporate names with ambitious climate pledges were noticeably absent from the Clean 200 list.\\nSo why aren\\'t Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) among the sustainable giants? It mostly comes down to disclosures.\\nMicrosoft\\'s actions have primarily focused on its operations, such as renewable energy projects and managing water usage. However, Malinsky noted, the company doesn\\'t provide enough detailed information about product revenue to determine the portion coming from technologies that are supporting the low-carbon economy transition.\\nLikewise, Amazon shoppers may recognize the \"Climate Pledge Friendly\" label when shopping online, but the actual level of sustainability varies widely for the self-reported eco-label.\\nFor instance, Heaps said that some products may receive the label if they have eco-friendly packaging, regardless of what the product is, whereas other products may qualify under more rigorous standards.\\nResearch shows that overall, companies with stronger ESG risk management practices tend to outperform benchmark peers over the long run.\\nSince July 2016, when the list was created, Clean 200 companies have outperformed the MSCI ACWI broad market index by 3.36%, the report stated, despite being underweight U.S. equities and energy stocks in 2022, a year when oil and gas companies benefitted from higher prices.\\nHeaps stressed that this demonstrates that even when investors use a \"fine tooth comb\" to weed out greenwashing — the practice of overstating sustainability credentials — there is no shortage of investable companies.\\n“This transformation that many have said is the equivalent of the Industrial Revolution is in full swing,” As You Sow\\'s Behar said. “It’s not a clean energy future, it is a clean energy present — and it is scaling rapidly.”\\nGrace is a special projects editor for Yahoo Finance.\\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\\n'),\n",
