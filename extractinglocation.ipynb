      "Norway accuses PTT-OR of supporting Myanmar's atrocities, orders pension funds to ban both investments Reporters report on the coup in Myanmar on the morning of February 1, 2021, with the Burma Army declaring a state of emergency a few hours later. And finally, there is a transfer of power to Senior General Min Aung Lai. Supreme Commander and head of the coup at that time western group Led by the United States and its allies, they condemned and opposed the coup. until the situation rapidly deteriorated This has resulted in demands and legislation forcing many foreign companies to stop investing. as well as all operations in Myanmar in order not to support the coup that may be considered a violation of human rights and the privacy rights of the Myanmar people seriously. It is reported that the PTT group has received letters from governments of many countries condemning the violence. by calling for the cessation of all operations in Myanmar Since many of PTT's affiliates have invested a lot and in a variety of business types The PTT Group has made several clarification letters certified by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand. He reaffirmed that the group had no involvement in supporting the coup and violating human rights. But all investments are related to energy security for Thailand only. However, the reporter reported that on May 10, 2022, the Council on Ethics of Norwegian Goverment Pension Fund Global GPFG suggested that the fund Stop investing in shares of PTT Public Company Limited or PTT and PTT Oil and Retail Public Company Limited or OR, which was the latest on December 15, the GPFG fund by the Bank of Norway. Norge Bank has taken steps to exclude shares of both companies from its investment portfolio. The Ethics Council stated the reason for the said recommendation that Due to various business activities of the PTT Group bring unacceptable risks. for engaging with the Myanmar government in serious violations of privacy rights As well as supporting the events of wars and various disputes that arise. PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited (PTTEP), a subsidiary of PTT, has entered into a partnership with Myanmar Oil and Gas (MOGE) in an offshore natural gas exploration and production project in Myanmar. of 3 sources while OR, which is another subsidiary It has entered into a joint venture with the Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) owned by the Burma Army. For the construction and operation of oil storage services or Oil Terminal and liquefied natural gas filling business or LNG Filling Facility. Recommendations from the Ethics Council In a nutshell, PTT and OR's business activities contribute to the revenue stream for the Burma Army's armed forces. that will be used in military activities for violations of privacy rights The partnership with MOGE and MEC reflects the unacceptable risks GPFG faces in supporting future brutality against the people of Myanmar.  The correspondent reports additionally from investigating the shareholding structure of one of the three projects of PTTEP referred to as The Yadana Project found that Unocal Myanmar Offshore Company Limited, a subsidiary of Chevron, an American company, is the number one largest shareholder with a stake of 41.1016%, followed by PTTEPI in the PTT Group with a stake of 37.0842%, and the last is MOGR, holding a stake of 21.8142%. Therefore, it was noted that Why are American companies like Chevron immune to condemnation and penalties for investing? because it is currently the largest shareholder and has received additional shares from Total, a French company who withdrew their investment earlier as well Meanwhile, the US government It is the mainstay of opposition to and condemning the Burma Army government of Myint Aung Laing. PTTEP, or PTTEP, had previously revealed to the news team. News about business stocks Previously, on issues that are related that Investing in Myanmar is considered to create energy security. decision to undertake this project It will help maintain continuity in natural gas supply to both countries to meet energy demand. and creating long-term energy security Including the continuity of natural gas exploration and production. that requires operational experience to ensure safety in every step The Yadana Project currently has an average sales volume of 770 million cubic feet per day. And sending natural gas for electricity generation accounts for 11% of the natural gas demand in Thailand and 50% of the natural gas demand of the people of Myanmar. Therefore, it is an indication that PTTEP has absolutely no involvement in supporting rights violations, but vice versa. PTTEP does not only focus on the energy security of Thai people. The company also takes into account the welfare and basic needs of the people of Myanmar who always have electricity to use. In this regard, from an examination of reference data as of September 29, 2022, it was found that GPFG held PTT shares through NVDR in the amount of 41.55 million shares, or approximately 0.15% of the shares, only in the process of checking whether the shares were held in the name. Another account too? While preliminary, it has not yet been verified that there are OR shares held on both the main board and the NVDR board.  \n"
